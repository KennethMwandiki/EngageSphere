# Accessibility Specification

This document lists core accessibility features by disability category, pragmatic implementation notes, testing guidance, and advanced AI-powered accessibility features for the project.

## Principles
- Follow WCAG 2.1 / 2.2 guidelines as baseline (AA target). Aim for AAA where feasible for key flows.
- Prioritize semantic HTML and progressive enhancement over purely JS-driven UI.
- Provide user control for presentation (contrast, text size, motion) and persist preferences per user.
- Test with real assistive tech and users where possible.

## 1. Blind / Low Vision

Features
- Screen reader support: semantic HTML structure (header/nav/main/footer), landmarks, ARIA where necessary, focus management, and meaningful alt text.
- Text-to-Speech & audio descriptions: optional narration for UI elements, charts, images and recorded media.
- High contrast & customizable themes: at least one WCAG AA/AAA high-contrast theme; user toggle saved in profile.
- Haptic feedback: support via OS-level APIs for mobile (brief guidance and patterns).

Implementation notes
- Use semantic elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <button>, <form>). Avoid div-only navigation.
- Provide aria-label/aria-labelledby for custom controls and role attributes for dynamic components.
- Ensure every interactive element is keyboard focusable and has visible focus styles.
- Images: supply descriptive alt; complex images: provide longdesc or dedicated description panel.
- Charts: provide textual data tables and an accessible summary; use ARIA live regions to announce updates.
- Text-to-Speech: implement an optional client-side TTS control using the Web Speech API with fallbacks.

Testing checklist
- NVDA (Windows), JAWS, VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), TalkBack (Android).
- Keyboard-only navigation (Tab order, focus traps, modal dialog flow).
- Screen reader reading order and ARIA announcements.

## 2. Deaf / Hard of Hearing

Features
- Live captions & subtitles: real-time transcription for audio/video (automated + human-corrected option).
- Sound recognition alerts: visual/haptic notification channels for critical system sounds.
- Sign language support: optional avatar or embedded interpreter for critical workflows.

Implementation notes
- Integrate with a captioning service for live streams (WebVTT for VOD, WebSocket/Realtime for live). Provide a visible captions toggle.
- For recorded media, provide synchronized captions and an accessible transcript.
- Sound recognition: on-device APIs or background service to detect triggers and surface UI notifications.

Testing checklist
- Verify captions accuracy and control toggles across browsers and devices.
- Ensure captions are selectable and accessible by screen readers when needed.

## 3. Mobility Impairments

Features
- Full keyboard navigation and accessible shortcuts.
- Voice control / speech command support.
- Switch device compatibility (sip-and-puff, eye gaze).

Implementation notes
- Ensure all tasks are possible via keyboard (no mouse-only flows). Provide skip links and clear focus styles.
- Offer configurable keyboard shortcuts and document them in Help.
- Voice control: expose a command API (e.g., a JS Command Registry) so different voice systems can map to actions.
- Support assistive hardware by relying on standard HTML inputs and ARIA where necessary (avoid custom low-level event handling that breaks device integration).

Testing checklist
- Keyboard-only flow for complex interactions (multi-step forms, dialogs, editors).
- Validate with common assistive devices/emulators or ask test users with adaptive hardware.

## 4. Neurodiverse Users

Features
- Customizable UI complexity: simplified and advanced view toggles.
- Reduced motion and flashing controls: user preference to reduce animations and auto-play.
- Predictable navigation and consistent layout.

Implementation notes
- Provide a "Simple Mode" that hides advanced controls and reduces visual noise.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion and provide a UI toggle to disable transitions/animations.
- Use clear affordances and progressive disclosure for complex tasks.

Testing checklist
- Usability testing with neurodiverse participants or accessibility testers.
- Ensure simple/advanced toggle persists per-user and is effective across pages.

## 5. Cognitive / Learning Disabilities

Features
- Plain language mode: simplified copy, icons, and short instructions.
- Step-by-step guided flows with contextual help.
- Error prevention and recovery: confirmations, undo and inline validation.

Implementation notes
- Provide short, clear prompts and avoid jargon. Offer a plain-language toggle.
- Break complex flows into incremental steps; include illustrative examples.
- For errors, surface clear remediation steps with inline guidance and an undo where feasible.

Testing checklist
- Cognitive walkthroughs and readability scoring (Flesch-Kincaid) checks for critical text.

## Advanced AI-powered features

- Accessibility Nutrition Labels: show a concise label describing which accessibility features a build/app supports (captions, screen reader compatibility, keyboard-only, color-contrast levels, etc.). This can be surfaced in the app store listing or download page.

- AI-powered assistance ("Be My Eyes" style):
  - Implement an optional AI assist endpoint that allows users to request an image description, layout narration, or real-time help. Route requests to a human fallback when confidence is low.
  - Privacy: capture metadata only, keep images encrypted in transit and respect user consent.

- Speech Adaptation AI:
  - Use speaker-adaptive ASR models and provide custom pronunciation dictionaries to improve recognition of atypical speech.
  - Provide per-user voice models where allowed (local storage or opt-in cloud models) to reduce latency and improve accuracy.

- Crowdsourced Accessibility Mapping:
  - Allow users to submit accessibility observations about venues (ramps, restrooms, automatic doors) and surface them on maps. Add moderation and reputation controls.

## Implementation priorities & roadmap

Short-term (sprint 1)
- Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation audit.
- Add captions toggle and integrate browser TTS for basic narration.
- Add "prefers-reduced-motion" support and a user toggle.

Mid-term (sprint 2)
- Full screen reader testing pass and ARIA reachability improvements.
- Implement plain-language mode and step-by-step flows for critical user journeys.

Long-term (sprint 3+)
- Signal/libsignal-based E2EE for private messaging flows (if required).
- AI-powered assistance (Be My Eyes) and speech adaptation pipelines.
- Crowdsourced accessibility mapping with moderation and export.

---

## Testing & validation

- Create an accessibility test matrix that maps features to assistive technologies, browsers, and screen sizes.
- Automate basic checks: axe-core for unit/integration tests and Lighthouse accessibility audits in CI.
- Schedule periodic manual tests with real assistive tech and a small cohort of users representing different disabilities.

If you'd like, I can implement the short-term items now:
- Audit and fix the current frontend for semantic HTML and keyboard navigation.
- Add a captions toggle and integrate basic Web Speech API narration.
- Add `prefers-reduced-motion` support and a UI toggle.

Tell me which short-term item to start with and I'll implement it and update the todo list accordingly.
